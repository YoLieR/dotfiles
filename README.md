# My dotfiles

A few of my personal config files.

I gathered a lot of the configs from other people or organisations. Special thanks to all of them.  
Most of the time I've linked to the original resources inside the config files.

Feel free to try out everything.
If you have tips for improvements, or you know some packages I don't use jet,
please write me an Email at: steffenschmid94(at)gmx(dot)de
